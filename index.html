          <p class="lead">I am passionate about taking cutting edge science/technology and delivering high impact and practical applications. I bring years of advanced (doctoral) research training in engineering and bioengineering, tech product development, and startup experience. I use my scientific and engineering expertise to lead the development of scientific research & novel applications, product innovation & strategy, commercialization of technology, and strategic partnerships across industry and academia. My previous projects/products have been featured in news outlets such as National Geographic, Newsweek, Syfy Network, and the New York Times.
<br /><br />
I am currently a venture capitalist at Boost VC, where we invest in futuristic science and technology. Our goal at Boost VC is to accelerate innovation that brings Sci-Fi closer to reality. Prior to Boost, I served as the Director of Product & Chief Scientist at Force Impact Technologies (FIT). Our main product was a wearable technology sensor that allows us to understand how an athlete's brain health is affected by impacts to the head. We used the collected data to track the athlete's head health and provide actionable insights to help with recovery and performance.
<br /><br />
Before joining FIT, I completed my Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Stanford University in the CamLab, developing novel biotechnologies to understand and prevent traumatic brain injury. The CamLab studies the biomechanics of concussion through the development of diagnostic sensors, preventative equipment, and computational models of the brain and cervical spine. I spearheaded the development of electronic mouthguards embedded with inertial sensors to measure the severity of head impacts to athletes in football, lacrosse, MMA, and other contact sports. To understand the scope of concussions and their relation to the biomechanical loads on the brain, my work involved clinical trials with hundreds of high school and collegiate athletes.
<br /><br />
I previously finished my Ph.D. at Harvard University where I studied materials science and mechanical engineering on full scholarship from the university (in addition to being a Pierce Fellow, Winston Chen Fellow, Kao Fellow, and Dudley Fellow). The topic of my thesis was bio-inspired design for mechanical and biomechanical applications. In addition, I completed a Master's Degree in materials science and mechanical engineering at Harvard.
<br /><br />
Before attending Harvard, I completed my Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering at Northwestern University. While at Northwestern, in addition to the research that I did throughout the school year in the Neuroscience and Robotics Laboratory and the Solid Mechanics/Computational Laboratory, I was the Co-Founder and Vice President of the newly formed Northwestern University Chapter of Engineers Without Borders. During my time at Northwestern, I also was a member of the National Honorary Fraternity for Engineers, Tau Beta Pi, and Northwesternâ€™s Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate Advisory Board, all while still maintaining a 3.99/4.00 GPA (graduated #1 in the School of Engineering and Applied Science). In my spare time, I enjoyed playing intramural football, basketball, and softball.
<br /><br />
Throughout my work experience and studies at Harvard, Stanford, and Northwestern, I have become proficient in many types of CAD, including SolidWorks, Pro/ENGINEER, and Unigraphics NX. I have also learned basic coding in various programming languages, including Java, Python, and Matlab.

          <p class="lead">I worked at Motorola Mobility when the Droid Razr cell phone was being developed. This gave me the opportunity to perform failure analysis and redesign for the volume and power buttons of the Droid Razr. In addition, I gathered and analyzed data on the performance of their new battery design, which did not have a hard casing in order to slim down the battery and ultimately the phone. If the the phone ever needed to be disassembled for repair, the battery deformed when removed from the circuit board because this type of battery did not have a hard casing. This gave me a chance to work as a part of a failure analysis project to quantify the extent of battery deformation upon removal. The data I gathered was presented to chemical engineers with whom a team, which included myself, worked to determine at what point a battery was no longer reusable based on the deformation. This data affected the design of the phone itself and prescribed a suggested process of battery removal in order to avoid damage that prevented the reuse of the battery.</p>

          <p class="lead">In the Neuroscience and Robotics Laboratory, I designed and built a device that uses DAQ hardware and several load cells to measure forces exerted by a user on the surface of the device. Using this device, I was able to study 2 topics:</br></br>
          1. How using a thumb as part of a pinch grip, in comparison to just using an index finger to explore the surface, affects a personâ€™s perception of the surface.</br>
          2. How forces exerted by a user are a function of the actual and perceived height of a bump on the surface.</p>
